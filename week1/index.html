<p class="intro">
	Creative and vigilant individuals need a watchful lawyer who understands their passions, who feels their needs and can give them solutions and 
new perspectives through the complicated maze of their legal worries. There is where I come in to help you built your dreams. <br>
	My name is Mary Talasli, I am an Attorney of law living in Syros, a greek island of the Aegean sea. <br>
	Focusing on legal needs of land investors in Greece, as land is one of the best investments somebody can make, especially in a place where sea
and sun dominate.<br> 
After graduating with honors from Syros’ First General Senior High School in 1993, I earned a legal degree at the School of Law Economics and Political Sciences of the University of Athens in 1999.  As I wanted to look into the law science, I pursued a Master’s Program of Legal Sociology in 2001.<br>
From June 2001 till today I am a member of Syros Bar Association,  practicing Private Law (Civil Law, Contract Law, Family Law), Public Law (Criminal Law, Administrative Law, Immigration Law, Construction Law). <br>
My clients include foreigners and greek land  investors both individuals and companies, as I speak fluently English and French.<br>
After practicing private law for years I decided on 2013 to do a Training in Mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution, becoming an Accredited Mediator from the Greek Ministry of Justice. Public Administration is always an interesting field to deal with so on 2016 I got a Master’s Degree at Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences in Athens.</p>

<p class="goals">
Everything new is a passion to me that keeps me up at night. With hard work and dedication, i eventually face any new challenge given from scratch, combining my inner hanger for new knowledge, my creativity, my imagination and devotion in order to succeed. That is always the right path to follow, which may overcome all the obstacles i might face during my new career loop.</p>

<p class="goals">
Always have in mind that no one should be excluded. Twenty percent of us humans globally, have a form of disability that makes us unique, but unfortunately excluded from everyday tasks others take for granted. Do not be part of that equation, inspire others to change their point of view  towards those in need. Make web content accessible to all.</p><br>
